      <h2> Hello, my name is Jake Alexander. This is my website, JS Gaming. Here, you can browse and play incredibly
           elementary Javascript games. The purpose in making this website was simple; <br /> <br />

           1) Create a place to organize all of the games I've made while learning and practicing Javascript <br />
           2) So others can see how simple it is to create awesome and fun games while learning to code! <br /> <br />

           I currently have 2 games available, 'Color Guess' and 'Face Match'. Additionally, because half of the reason for this site is for learning,
           I have created a page that houses the code for each of the games. <br /> <br />

           Have fun and try to recreate these on your own!
